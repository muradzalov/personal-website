const Description = 'A little bit about myself: I am an aspiring software developer! I first became interested in software development while working in consulting, where I built regression models and revenue performance Excel workbooks. I learned that JavaScript and front-end tools could be leveraged to create more robust solutions, and I quickly developed a passion for programming. I was able to convert many of our Excel workbooks into simple front-end applications that alleviated a lot of manual effort each week. After that, I knew that software development was something I wanted to pursue full-time. \n \n I enrolled in a coding bootcamp in Chicago and graduated in 2020. I\'m most experienced with JavaScrpt, Node.js, React, Redux, and Express, but also I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and am an avid learner. In my free time, I enjoy coding, reading books, and training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. \n \n If you would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me! I am looking for new opportunities in software engineering, and I hope I can join a great team that I can learn from and contribute to. \n \n -Murad'
